                        <p>Stellar Guesser was developed as a tool for learning the night sky in a game-like manner. The
                            default question packs provide a learning path from the very basics to knowledge suitable
                            for contestants aiming to win a gold medal at the IOAA. It is also possible
                            to create custom question packs for a personalised learning experience. There is a large
                            selection of question types, which can for example test your knowledge of deep-sky
                            objects, star designations, constellation borders or focus on skills such as estimating
                            coordinates, distances between objects, magnitudes of stars or identifying missing stars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding olympiad preparation, the application covers the vast majority of the factual
                            knowledge required for the practical rounds at the IOAA – sky map, planetarium, and
                            telescopes. Of course, there is more to those rounds than just knowing a lot of information,
                            for example being able to point a telescope and some tasks being more focused on
                            measurements. However, being able to find your way around the night sky is usually crucial,
                            or at least very helpful.

                        <p>You can launch the application in the browser <a href="./play/">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>It should be possible to "install" the website as an "app" on both mobile and desktop. It
                            will still run in a browser, but should not require an internet connection to be loaded.</p>
                        <p>Please note that web is not the primary platform, so it is recommended to <a
                                id="download_button" href="#download">download</a> an executable for one of the primary
                            platforms if possible. Web browsers have some limitations in place over native environments,
                            so not all features can be present in the web version. However, there should not be any
                            critical features missing.</p>

                        <p>The primary platform is Windows - everything should be fully functional there. There are also
                            releases for Android, which are made to be as functional as possible, with some limitations
                            and workarounds due to the incompleteness of the integration between Android and the
                            frameworks used for development. However, 9.5 times out of 10 these issues are purely
                            visual, not functional (there are workarounds in place for functional issues).</p>
                        <p>All releases can be found <a href="./all_releases/">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>Note: Some releases may include multiple versions for the same platform. Please refer to the
                            release notes to learn what are the differences between those builds and choose
                            the version that suits your needs the best.</p>
